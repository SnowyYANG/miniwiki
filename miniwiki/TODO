TODO list:

- recent changes page
- layout page describing how everything looks (not just header and footer)
- install/upgrade script (including db scheme change (needs support in
  storages) and default pages update)
- per-user access rights (includes moving MW_Auth into extension)
- Wiki spaces (hierarchical page spaces)
- convert Special pages to use Wiki markup
- allow pages to see custom request parameters
- unified way of indicating what pages produce (by specifying MIME type of
  output) and allow rendering into different formats ((X)HTML, PDF, text...)
- import/export of pages and other data (used also by install/upgrade)
