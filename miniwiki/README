Requirements
------------

Web server (e.g. Apache HTTP server)
PHP 4.3.x or newer (may work on older 4.x versions)
MySQL 4.0.x or newer (may work on older 3.x versions)

Installation
------------

Unpack distribution archive somewhere under your web server's document
directory, make changes in userdefs.php and maintenance/.htaccess as hinted
inside, change $install_pass in maintenance/install.php and point your browser
to it, when asked for username and password use the ones
from inside the script (stored in variables $install_user and $install_pass).
Script will then fill the storage with initial data. Do not forget to close access
to install.php in maintenance/.htaccess.

Upgrade from development snapshots
----------------------------------

Upgrade from development snapshots (or SVN HEAD) may result in nonfunctional
user interface. In that case try to identify what change caused that and repair
it manually in the storage.

Upgrade from previous versions
------------------------------

Unpack distribution archive over the previous version. Because directory
structure changed, remove all PHP, CSS and JS files in the root directory
with the exception of index.php and userdefs.php.
Finally backup your database, make changes in maintenance/.htaccess as hinted
inside, change $install_pass in maintenance/install.php and point your browser
to it, when asked for username and password use the ones
from inside the script (stored in variables $install_user and $install_pass).
Script will then upgrade the storage. Do not forget to close access
to install.php in maintenance/.htaccess.

Since version 0.3 main page name is Main Page and not MainPage. It will get renamed
during upgrade and MainPage will be redirected to new page.

Since version 0.3 UI layout is stored in Wiki pages MW/Layout/* including
CSS and JS files which were previously in data directory and now are
stored as uploaded files.

Since version 0.3 namespace separator is / and not :. Because in pre-0.3 versions
namespaces were not official, only user pages (User:*) will be renamed (to User/*).

Since version 0.3 all user settings are prefixed with mw_, that is $auth_read_logged_only
and $auth_write_admin_only are now called $mw_auth_read_logged_only
and $mw_auth_write_admin_only respectively.

Pages and uploads which are already present will be stored with suffix "-Imported".

Execution
---------

Point your web browser to index.php. Log in as user admin with
password admin and enjoy the Wiki.
