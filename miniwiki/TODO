TODO list:

- multi-line {{...}}
- improve code docs
- classify standalone pages (use layout pages and for now fake them with PHP code)
- recent changes page
- layout page describing how everything looks (not just header and footer)
- per-user access rights (includes moving MW_Auth into extension)
- Wiki spaces (hierarchical page spaces) - called clusters in storage
- convert Special pages to MW:Special:*
- unified way of indicating what pages produce (by specifying MIME type of
  output) and allow rendering into different formats ((X)HTML, PDF, text...)
- search
- wiki function _()
- Subversion storage (including support for Subversion-based users management)
  - unified pages and uploads hierarchies
  - treat / and : equally as directory separator (based on filesystem storage)
- remove all unnecessary is_a() calls
