miniWiki 0.3 (c)2005,2006 Stepan Roh
------------------------------------

miniWiki is simple Wiki written in PHP which uses MySQL as its storage.

Requirements
------------

Web server (e.g. Apache HTTP server)
PHP 4.3.x or newer (may work on older 4.x versions)
MySQL 4.0.x or newer (may work on older 3.x versions)

Installation
------------

Unpack distribution archive somewhere under your web server's document
directory and execute MySQL script miniwiki.sql (or miniwiki_empty.sql for
installation without initial content).

Upgrade from previous versions
------------------------------

Unpack distribution archive over the previous version. Because directory
structure changed, remove all PHP, CSS and JS files in the root directory
with the exception of index.php and userdefs.php.
Finally backup your database, make changes in maintenance/.htaccess as hinted
inside, change $install_pass in maintenance/install.php and point your browser
to it, when asked for username and password use the ones
from inside the script (stored in variables $install_user and $install_pass).
Script will then upgrade the storage. Finally, do not forget to close access
to install.php in maintenance/.htaccess.

Since version 0.3 main page name is Main Page and not MainPage. This
is not handled by upgrade process and transition must be done by hand.

Since version 0.3 UI layout is stored in Wiki pages MW:Layout:* including
CSS and JS files which were previously in data directory and now are
stored as uploaded files mw/layout/*.

Setup
-----

Change variables in userdefs.php to your settings (set database settings to
those used when miniwiki.sql script was executed).

Execution
---------

Point your web browser to index.php. You'll be either presented with main
documentation page (if miniwiki.sql was used) or with error message (if
miniwiki_empty.sql was used). In either case log in as user admin with
password admin and enjoy the Wiki.
