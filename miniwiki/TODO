TODO list:

- year 2006
- improve code docs
- unify class names (to PrefixMixedCaps)
- classify standalone pages
- recent changes page
- layout page describing how everything looks (not just header and footer)
- install/upgrade script (including db scheme change (needs support in
  storages) and default pages update)
- upgrade: user -> author
- per-user access rights (includes moving MW_Auth into extension)
- Wiki spaces (hierarchical page spaces)
- convert Special pages to use Wiki markup
- allow pages to see custom request parameters
- unified way of indicating what pages produce (by specifying MIME type of
  output) and allow rendering into different formats ((X)HTML, PDF, text...)
- import/export of pages and other data (used also by install/upgrade)
- #REDIRECT support
- search
- convert last_modified value to/from unified format and UTC timezone in the storage
  - format_last_modified() should convert to current timezone (represented by envvar TZ)
