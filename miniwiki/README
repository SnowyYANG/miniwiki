miniWiki 0.2 (c)2005 Stepan Roh
-------------------------------

miniWiki is simple Wiki written in PHP which uses MySQL as its storage.

Requirements
------------

Web server (e.g. Apache HTTP server)
PHP 4.3.x or newer (may work on older 4.x versions)
MySQL 4.0.x or newer (may work on older 3.x versions)

Installation
------------

Unpack distribution archive somewhere under your web server's document
directory and execute MySQL script miniwiki.sql (or miniwiki_empty.sql for
installation without initial content).

Upgrade from 0.1
----------------

Unpack distribution archive over the previous version. Because directory
structure changed, remove all PHP, CSS and JS files in the root directory
with the exception of index.php and userdefs.php.
Finally backup your database and execute MySQL script upgrade_from_0_1.sql. 

Setup
-----

Change variables in userdefs.php to your settings (set database settings to
those used when miniwiki.sql script was executed).

Execution
---------

Point your web browser to index.php. You'll be either presented with main
documentation page (if miniwiki.sql was used) or with error message (if
miniwiki_empty.sql was used). In either case log in as user admin with
password admin and enjoy the Wiki.
